Translating between binary, hex, and decimal numbers
This semester you will often translate between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal numbers.  I assume you know how to do these translations.  These problems will help you re-familiarize yourself with the process.  Please solve the problems by hand and do not use web resources except as needed to understand the process.
Edit file binhex.txt to enter your answers to the following problem. 
1. Write the following binary numbers as decimal numbers.  For example, write 10110 as 22.
   1. 22                
   2. 7                
   3. 3                
   4. 25                
   5. 255        
1. Write the following decimal numbers in binary.  For example, write 13 as 1101.
   1. 1101                
   2. 10101                
   3. 10000                
   4. 110111                
   5. 1010000                
1. Write the following hexadecimal numbers as decimal numbers.  For example, write 0x2C as 44 (which is 2*16 + 12*1).  The “0x” is often used to indicate hex numbers.
   1. 44                
   2. 18                
   3. 471               
   4. 255               
   5. 123               
1. Write the following decimal numbers as hex.  For example, write 18 as 0x12 (which is 1*16 + 2*1).  Do not forget to provide the “0x”.
   1. 0x12                
   2. 0x5                
   3. 0x58                
   4. 0x7B                
   5. 0x64
