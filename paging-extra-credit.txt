# special extra credit assignment on paging - please read carefully
#

# In the problems below I ask you to calculate the values of
# some parameters in a virtual address space given other parameters.

# Variables:
# NBA: number of bits in the virtual address
# NBO: number of bits for offset in the virtual address
# NBP: number of bits for VPN in the virtual address
# NP:  number of pages
# SA:  size of the virtual address space
# SP:  size of a virtual page
#
# The units of SA and SP are bytes, and I'm assuming that
# each byte of memory has its own address.

# For example, suppose a virtual address has 32 bits, and the
# size of a page is 4 KB.  How many page bits and offset bits
# in the virtual address?
#
# Solution: Since the page size is 4 KB, the number of offset
# bits must be 12, because log2(4*1024) is 12.  Then the
# the number of page bits must be 20, since there are 32 bits
# in the virtual address, and subtracting the 12 offset bits
# we get 20.

# To solve the problems you can use these relationships
# between the variables:
#
# NBA = log2(SA), or equally  SA = 2^NBA
# NBP = log2(NP), or equally  NP = 2^NBP
# NBO = log2(SP), or equally  SP = 2^NBO
# NBO + NBP = NBA
#
# For example, suppose SP (size of a page) is 1024 bytes.  Then
# the number of offset bits in the virtual address must be log2(1024),
# which is 10.
