# Problem lines begin with "#@".
# For each problem line, put your answer *on the following line*.
# Do not modify this file in any way except to insert your answers.
#

# Each problem line shows a malloc or free operation.  On the line
# after the problem line, enter the free list in the style shown
# in the homework instructions.
# For example:  (1004,5) -> (1009,91) 
# (spaces are ignored)
# If you don't use the correct format you won't get credit for your answers. 

#@ 1  free(ptr1)  (write the free list)

#@ 2  ptr2 = alloc(3)
(1003,1) -> (1004,5) -> (1009,91)
#@ 3  free(ptr2)
(1000,3) -> (1003,1) -> (1004,5) -> (1009,91)
#@ 4  ptr3 = alloc(10)
(1000,3) -> (1003,1) -> (1004,5) -> (1019,81)
#@ 5  ptr4 = alloc(8)
(1000,3) -> (1003,1) -> (1004,5) -> (1027,73)

#@ 9  ptr4 = alloc(13)
(1002,2) -> (1015,13) -> (1082,18)
